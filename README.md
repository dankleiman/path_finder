Find Any Value in a Compound Data Structure
============================================

Given a value and a compound data structure, returns the position in the strucure, formatted so you can referrence it in your code.

How to use this tool:

+ To find a single, unique value, run the program from "path_finder.rb"
+ To display multiple paths for a value, run the program from "craigs_path_finder.rb"
+ There is no UI, yet.
+ Update "favorite_movies" on line 71 with your data structure
+ Update the parameters for "raw_path = pathfinder(THE VALUE YOU WANT TO FIND, YOUR DATA STRUCTURE)"

Later versions will hopefully include:

+ An interface that allows you to enter the value when you run the program.
+ Support for CSV file access to a data set.
+ a gem you can include in your rails project

Questions and feedback welcome!

Thanks.
