Find Any Value in a Compound Data Structure
============================================

Given a value and a compound data structure, returns the position in the strucure, formatted so you can referrence it in your code.

How to use this tool:

+ The program runs from "path_finder.rb" (all other files will be cleaned up -- just test files)
+ There is no UI, yet.
+ Update "favorite_movies" on line 71 with your data structure
+ Update the parameters for "raw_path = pathfinder(THE VALUE YOU WANT TO FIND, YOUR DATA STRUCTURE)"

Currently, the program returns the first instance of your value.

Later versions will hopefully include:

+ Returns for all occurences of your value.
+ An interface that allows you to enter the value when you run the program.
+ Support for CSV file access to a data set.

Questions and feedback welcome!

Thanks.
